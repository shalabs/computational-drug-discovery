The [*ChEMBL Database*](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) is a database that contains curated bioactivity data of more than 2 million compounds. It is compiled from more than 76,000 documents, 1.2 million assays and the data spans 13,000 targets and 1,800 cells and 33,000 indications.


This repo contains a collection of notebooks of exploratory analysis and a machine learning model built using the ChEMBL bioacitivty data given a specific disease. In this instance SARS-CoV-2 was used to produce ML classifiers that could be deployed and applied to determine the bioacitity of a drug towards the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
